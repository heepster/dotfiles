# Note: Bitwig needs yabridge to be in its path in order to load plugins properly
# If you launch bitwig from the command line, and yabridge is in your PATH
# then it seems like Bitwig "remembers" this even when launched from application launcher

# Debug notes
#  /opt/bitwig-studio/bin/BitwigPluginHost-X64-SSE41 test ~/.vst/yabridge/Kontakt.so
